Check first:
Kile needs at least KDE 3.3 and Qt 3.3, without it you cannot run Kile. 
Also to compile Kile you need to install the development packages for KDE 3.3 
and Qt 3.3 as well.

To compile source files :
1.cd to the directory containing the package's source code and type :
./configure --prefix=path to KDE3 (/usr or /opt/kde3 generally) --with-qt-dir=path to the QT3 library (/usr/lib/qt3 generally)
2. Type make to compile the package.
3. Type make install to install the programs and any data files and documentation.
If you don't know what is the path to KDE 3 on your system, you can use this command with a terminal :
kde-config --prefix
