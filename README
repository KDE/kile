Dear User/Packager,

this Readme is targeted towards people who want to build Kile from source or plan to create binary packages.
If you have created a package, please drop us a note ( kile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net ) so that we can promote your package.
All specified versions are minimum versions except for KDE and QT.

1.) Checking dependencies

- kdelibs 3.2 - 3.5 and according QT development packages
- autoconf 2.53, automake and make (alternatively cmake 2.4.4, see also Building-with-cmake.txt)
- gcc 3.x/4.x

2.) Building Kile from source

- Extract the source code with `tar xjf kile-2.0.x.tar.bz2`
- `cd kile-2.0.x`
- ./configure --prefix=path_to_KDE3 (/usr or /opt/kde3 generally) --with-qt-dir=path_to_QT3 library (/usr/lib/qt3 generally)
	-- If you don't know what the path to KDE3 on your system is, you can use output of `kde-config --prefix`.
	-- Or you can choose `--prefix=$HOME/.kde` to not mess up with your distribution's package management system.
- Type `make` to compile the package.
- Type `make install` to install the programs, data files and documentation.
- Type `kile` and enjoy the power of LaTeX together with the joy of using Kile :)

3.) Using Kile

To use Kile you (obviously) need some external programs.
The following list is divided into basic, advanced and additional usage.

Basic:

- Latex2html (LaTeX to Web)
- Tex4ht (LaTeX to Web)
