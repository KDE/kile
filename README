Dear User/Packager,

this Readme is targeted towards people who want to build Kile from source or plan to create binary packages.
If you have created a package, please drop us a note ( kile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net ) so that we can promote your package.

1.) Checking dependencies
============================

- kdelibs 4.2 or KDE trunk and according QT development packages
- cmake 2.6.2
- gcc 3.x/4.x

2.) Building Kile from source
============================

- Extract the source code with "tar xjf kile-x.tar.bz2"
- Create a "kile-build" directory somewhere for an out-of-source build.
- Enter the "kile-build" directory and call cmake with:
  " cmake <path to the kile directory> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/.kde4 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debugfull" "
- Type "make -j 2" to compile the package.
- Type "make install -j 2" to install the programs, data files and documentation.
- Type "kile" and enjoy the power of LaTeX together with the joy of using Kile :)

2.1.) Building Documentation
============================

The documentation will automatically be built provided that the documentation files
are located in the following directories:
<kile-root>
           /doc                                   for the standard documentation and
                                                  accompanying image files

           /translations
                        /<language>
                                   /doc           for the translated documentation and
                                                  images in language <language>

                                   /messages      for the translated message catalogs
                                                  in language <language>

Please note that every docbook must be called "index.docbook" and that only PNG image
files can be used. Furthermore, message catalogs must be called "kile.po".

When the "doc" and "translations" directories are found, the build targets "docbooks"
and "translations" will be generated for the compiling of the documentation.

2.3.) Special Flags for the build
===============================
The flag "KILE_VERSION" can be set in the CMake cache to specify the installation
directory of basic documentation files (README, AUTHORS, ChangeLog,...), i.e. they
will be installed in "share/doc/kile-${KILE_VERSION}/" instead of "share/doc/kile/".

3.) Using Kile
===============================

To use Kile you (obviously) need some external programs.
The following list is divided into basic, advanced and additional usage.

Basic:
- TeXLive 2005/2007/2008 (Including "AMS"-Packages and the documentation).
  This add among others the following programs:
    - Tex/LaTeX
    - PDFLaTeX
    - XeLaTeX
    - ConTeXt
    - BibTeX
    - MakeIndex
- Okular (DVI, PS, PDF Viewer from KDE)

Advanced:
- Acroread (Viewing PDF)
- Imagemagick, DVIPNG 1.7 (Bottom bar preview)

By default there are also tools for the following programs defined:
- Tar/zip/gzip/bzip2 (Archive)
- DBlatex (Docbook to LaTeX)
- Metapost and Asymptote
- Latex2html (LaTeX to Web)
- Tex4ht (LaTeX to Web)
- Xindy (MakeIndex replacement)
- Lilypond (Music Typesetting)
- Konqueror/Mozilla/Firefox (Viewing HTML)
- Kbibtex, KBib, JabRef, pybliographer, gbib (View Bibtex files)

If you have any questions or corrections, please don't hesitate to contact us via kile-devel@lists.sourceforge.net.
