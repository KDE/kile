Dear User/Packager,

this Readme is targeted toward users who want to build Kile from source or plan to create binary packages on Linux systems


(1) Checking dependencies
============================

You will need recent versions of

- a C++ compiler that supports lambda expressions (like GCC 6.x)
- CMake
- Qt 5 (and corresponding development packages if installed from binary packages)
- KDE Frameworks 5 (and corresponding development packages if installed from binary packages)
- Okular 5 (and corresponding development packages if installed from binary packages)

(2) Building Kile from source on Linux systems
==============================================

It is recommended to create a special directory which will contain the Kile executable and related files. In that way
it is easier to upgrade Kile. We assume in the following that the directory $HOME/kile-install is used for that purpose.
If you do not want to use a separate directory, you can also install Kile into the local KDE directory for your user,
which is named $HOME/.kde usually. The different steps for compiling Kile are now as follows:

- Extract the source code with "tar xjf kile-<x>.tar.bz2"
- Create a "kile-build" directory somewhere for an out-of-source build.
- Enter the "kile-build" directory and call CMake with:
  " cmake <path to the Kile source directory> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/kile-install -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug" "
- Type "make -j 2" to compile the package.
- Type "make install -j 2" to install the programs, data files and documentation.
- Type "XDG_DATA_DIRS=$HOME/kile-install/:$XDG_DATA_DIRS $HOME/kile-install/bin/kile" to run Kile

(3) Using Kile
===============================

To use Kile you (obviously) need some external programs.
The following list is divided into basic, advanced and additional usage.

Basic:
- TeXLive LaTeX distribution, which will add, among others, the following programs:
    - Tex/LaTeX
    - PDFLaTeX
    - XeLaTeX
    - ConTeXt
    - BibTeX
    - MakeIndex

Advanced:
- ImageMagick, DVIPNG (for the bottom bar preview)

By default Kile ships with pre-defined tool settings for following programs:
- Tar/Zip/GZip/BZip2 (Archive)
- DBLaTeX (Docbook to LaTeX)
- Metapost and Asymptote
- LaTeX2html (LaTeX to Web)
- Tex4ht (LaTeX to Web)
- Xindy (MakeIndex replacement)
- Lilypond (Music Typesetting)
- Konqueror/Firefox (Viewing HTML)
- KBibTeX, KBib, JabRef, PyBliographer, GBib (View BibTeX files)
