TODO
 - allow users to set a preferred shell
  
 - improving template support
 
 - create a plain text importer (one that would convert % to \%, $ to \$ etc.)
 
 - create a fast powerful (La)TeX parser

- recursive sectioning: also parse sections that were inserted with
 \input or \include (optional)

- file_selector could use a configurable filter. Now only *.tex files are
 shown, some people might use a .ltx extension for their LaTeX files (or
 something completely different).

- #142987 project load crash

- add biblatex support, see https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=1126005&aid=2395904&group_id=244752 and 2.4.4 in the biblatex manual

- strange ref error see http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1746112&forum_id=292014 and BTS

- the existence of the file .ind should not be checked for makeindex,. becasue it is for example for glosstex not necessary
- remove number in front of the user tags, this looks really stupid if you put them into the toolbar

docu:
- explain tool stuff and the magic %... abbreviations
