TODO
 - allow users to set a preferred shell
  
 - improving template support
 
 - create a plain text importer (one that would convert % to \%, $ to \$ etc.)
 
 - create a fast powerful (La)TeX parser

- recursive sectioning: also parse sections that were inserted with
 \input or \include (optional)

- file_selector could use a configurable filter. Now only *.tex files are
 shown, some people might use a .ltx extension for their LaTeX files (or
 something completely different).

 - and much more ...
