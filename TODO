BUGS
 - shell quote filenames in tools (filenames with spaces etc.)
 - When "\section" is re-defined in the preamble of a document, the structure view considers it
   as a section.

TODO
 - use iterators instead of [] (especially for qstringlist and alike)

 - use KDirWatch to check for modified files on disk
 
 - version control for the kilerc file, now users have to delete
   the old kilerc file when they upgrade to a new version

 - inherit QListView for the structureview (current code is very inefficient)

 - also handle .ltx files

 - recursive sectioning: also parse sections that were inserted with
   \input or \include (optional)

 - Save As: When you do a "save as" for the first time, the directory should
   be changed to the one visible in the file_selector.

 - file_selector could use a configurable filter. Now only *.tex files are
   shown,  some people might use a .ltx extension for their LaTeX files (or
  something  completely different).

 - project management (start a project, adds files to the project, use make
   to build the project)

 - It would be nice if the postscript/dvi/pdf files are automatically update
   when they are "outdated", similar to the way "make" works.
