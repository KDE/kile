TODO
 - trying to compile an untitled document should initiate a
   'Save As' dialog instead of the error 'could not start command'

 - write a Kile handbook (in the docbook format)

 - Automatically backup files (at a regular interval)

 - fix error when quickbuild is stopped
 
 - inverse search: kile is started and a Goto dialog is presented, could do
   without it the Goto dialog :-)

 - recursive sectioning: also parse sections that were inserted with
   \input or \include (optional)

 - Save As: When you do a "save as" for the first time, the directory should
   be changed to the one visible in the file_selector.

 - file_selector could use a configurable filter. Now only *.tex files are
   shown,  some people might use a .ltx extension for their LaTeX files (or
  something  completely different).

 - project management (start a project, adds files to the project, use make
   to build the project)

 - It would be nice if the postscript/dvi/pdf files are automatically update
   when they are "outdated", similar to the way "make" works.

 - make error messages more specific ("could not start command" is not very
   informative in my humble opinion)

 - add comments to source-code

BUGS
 - KShellView crashes when it is started as an embedded viewer AND it shows a
   tooltip at startup (very weird, probably a KShellView bug).
