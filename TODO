TODO
 - find out why LaTeX is running slower when started within Kile (compared to starting it from the command line)
 
 - add more, improving existing wizards

 - allow users to set a preferred shell
  
 - improving template support
 
 - finishing the ASCII <-> encoding converters (convert accented letters into TeX sequences)
 
 - create a plain text importer (one that would convert % to \%, $ to \$ etc.)
 
 - create a fast powerful (La)TeX parser

 - recursive sectioning: also parse sections that were inserted with
   \input or \include (optional)

 - file_selector could use a configurable filter. Now only *.tex files are
   shown,  some people might use a .ltx extension for their LaTeX files (or
  something  completely different).

 - and much more ...
