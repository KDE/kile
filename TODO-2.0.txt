to fix:
	- #142987 project load crash
	- grepping files does not work if kile.encoding != system.encoding, try e.g. UTF8 vs. latin1 with umlauts [grep can't do the job, so this is in my eyes a candidate for a known limitation]
	- TExlive 2007 compliance with help files (does not work out of the box)
docu:
- #130910

- preview
- explain tool stuff and the magic %... abbreviations
