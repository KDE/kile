general:
- fix duplicated shortcuts
- are lst files (in data/help) up to date?
- create ~/.lyx if it does not exist


tools:
- pdflatex complains about unsused bb option for \includegraphics from our graphics wizard (TexLive 2007)
- add kdesvn and sourcecode patch
- spell checker on the fly should ignore latex commands
regressions:
- create new project dialog, open file dialog does not work
- adding a file to a project, creates a yellow symbol for a with latex root doc. closing the project and reopening fixes it
