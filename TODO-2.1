general:
- fix duplicated shortcuts

tools:
- pdflatex complains about unsused bb option for \includegraphics (TexLive 2007)
- add kdesvn and sourcecode patch
- spell checker on the fly should ignore latex commands
regressions:
- create new project dialog, open file dialog does not work
- adding a file to a project, creates a yellow symbol for a with latex root doc. closing the project and reopening fixes it
