(-marks things to do, + done )

general:
- fix duplicated shortcuts
- are lst files (in data/help) up to date?
+ create ~/.lyx if it does not exist
- prevent having two kile services registered on d-bus
- cmake stuff has to be rechecked, especially the doc and translations handling might be unnecessary difficult because it was written for KDE3.
- try to get inverse search working in okular, see https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=159074

minor:
- some operator symbols look really ugly, but I (tbraun) have no idea why. The dvi and the pngs look good.
 
tools:
- pdflatex complains about unsused bb option for \includegraphics from our graphics wizard (TexLive 2007)
- add kdesvn and sourcecode patch

config stuff:
+ includegraphics wizard settings not stored in KConfig, this seems to be a bigger problem all over place

regressions:
- should complain if tool is not found
+ *_extensions are written to toplevel of project files instead of general
+ create new project dialog, open file dialog does not work
- adding a file to a project, creates a yellow symbol for a with latex root doc. closing the project and reopening fixes it

  In KDE 3.5 they have been taken from kdelibs and are now no longer present.

postponed after 2.1 release:
- spell checker on the fly should ignore latex commands
