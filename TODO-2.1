(-marks things to do, + done )

general:
- fix duplicated shortcuts
- are lst files (in data/help) up to date?
+ create ~/.lyx if it does not exist
- prevent having two kile services registered on d-bus


minor:
- some operator symbols look really ugly, but I (tbraun) have no idea why. The dvi and the pngs look good.
 
tools:
- pdflatex complains about unsused bb option for \includegraphics from our graphics wizard (TexLive 2007)
- add kdesvn and sourcecode patch
- spell checker on the fly should ignore latex commands

regressions:
+ *_extensions are written to toplevel of project files instead of general
- create new project dialog, open file dialog does not work
- adding a file to a project, creates a yellow symbol for a with latex root doc. closing the project and reopening fixes it
