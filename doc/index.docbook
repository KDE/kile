		<title>Basic facts</title>

		<sect2>

			<title>About &kile;</title>

			<para>&kile; is an integrated &latex; environment for the &kde; desktop. &kile; gives you the
			ability to use all the functionalities of &latex; in a graphical interface, giving you easy,
			immediate, and customized access to all programs for &latex; code-completion, compiling, postprocessing,
			debugging, conversion and viewing tools; you also get very handy wizards, a &latex;
			reference and a powerful project management.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2>

			<title>&kile; and the &kate; Editor Component</title>

			<para>&kile; is based on the &kate; editor component, i.e. a lot of its editing capabilities stem from the &kate;
			editor component itself. &kile; extends these capabilities with features to edit &latex; documents. To learn more
			about the &kate; editor component and its capabilities, see the <ulink url="http://kate-editor.org">&kate;
			webpage</ulink>.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2>

			<title>What is &latex;?</title>

			<para>&latex; is a text-processing system derived from &tex;, a program developed originally in
			1977 by Donald Knuth to help layout text in a professional way and obtain a layout quality that
			is on par with the work of a professional typesetter.
			&latex; was created by Leslie Lamport to give authors an automatic typesetter, especially to ease
			the expensive and painstaking process of typesetting of mathematical formulas and expressions,
			which are enclosed within dollar signs in &latex; <emphasis>for a reason</emphasis>.
			Today, word-processing programs let any user act as typesetter, but what is often needed
			is a document that simply looks good without having to spend hours to bring it into shape.
			&latex; takes that burden on its shoulders, and lets you concentrate on the document instead of on the layout.
			And yes, it <emphasis>will</emphasis> look good!</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2>

			<title>How do you pronounce it? Why that strange typesetting?</title>

			<para>There is a funny tradition of &tex;-related packages to have the strangest pronunciation
			and typesetting possible. &tex; was supposed to be brought in from the Greek <emphasis>τεχ</emphasis>,
			in Latin letters <emphasis>tech</emphasis>. There are a lot of explanations why, but most likely it is because
			&tex; was originally conceived for technical reports, and indeed its foremost ability was the correct and
			easy typesetting of mathematical formulae, then an extremely expensive, time-consuming and
			frustrating business.</para>
			<para>The pronunciation is supposed to be as follows: <emphasis>T</emphasis> as you would expect,
			<emphasis>E</emphasis> as in <emphasis>get</emphasis>, and <emphasis>X</emphasis> as in the
			German i<emphasis>ch</emphasis>. If you do not know what <emphasis>ch</emphasis> sounds like,
			it is more or less like the sound a hissing cat produces; the IPA symbol is /ç/. Many people report a different pronunciation
			of <emphasis>ach</emphasis> (IPA symbol /x/), but according to some Greeks, the first version is indeed correct.
			You should be aware that a lot of people mispronounce &tex; as /teks/ or /tek/.</para>
			<para>Last, in &latex; the first L<superscript>A</superscript> is pronounced as
			<emphasis>lay</emphasis>: the idea being, while raw &tex; is difficult, even a <emphasis>lay</emphasis>man
			can use &latex; macros. A less inspiring, but more realistic explanation is that it stems from the surname of
			Leslie Lamport, the creator of &latex;. Now you know!</para>

		</sect2>

	</sect1>

	<sect1 id="intro_latexbasics">

		<title>&latex; 101</title>

		<para>The &latex; typesetting system is similar to other markup languages such as &XML;, which is used in
		many types of documents (including the one you are reading), or &HTML;, which is used for web
		pages. The general idea behind markup languages is to have special keywords, called <emphasis>
		tags</emphasis>, that tell a program (a word processor, a web browser, or the &latex;
		compiler) how to the text enclosed within the tags is to be interpreted. &kile; offers a number of such tags in the
		<guimenu>LaTeX</guimenu> menu in the menu bar.</para>

		<para>While we will try to give you a good idea of what &latex; is, this document is, of course, not The Definitive
		Book on &latex;. If you want to learn &latex; in depth, you may want to borrow a specialized book from your local library.</para>

		<para>As any other markup language, &latex; documents contain a <emphasis>preamble</emphasis>, which
		defines global properties, such as paper size, page numbering, dimensions of the text on the page,
		and a document <emphasis>body</emphasis>, which contains the text of the document. The preamble is composed
		at least of the <userinput>\documentclass</userinput> command. It precedes the document body, which
		starts with the command <userinput>\begin{document}</userinput> is concluded with the command
		<userinput>\end{document}</userinput>.</para>

		<title>&kile;'s Main Features</title>

		<sect2 id="intro_docwizard">

			<title>QuickStart Wizard</title>

			<para>The QuickStart wizard built into &kile; is a useful feature to quickly start creating documents
			in &kile;. Choosing the wizard from the menubar gives you several choices
			for the creation of your document.
			You can also specify some options related to the document right away.</para>

			<para>Class options:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Document Class</guilabel>: choose the type of document you want to create:
				 article, book, letter, report, scrartcl, scrreprt, scrbook, prosper, beamer or other
				 custom-defined.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Typeface Size</guilabel>: tell &kile; what point size (pt)
				you want to use.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Paper Size</guilabel>: choose the size or style of sheets.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Encoding</guilabel>: In general it is a good idea to use your system's standard
						encoding. Modern systems now move more and more to UTF-8 as the standard encoding.
						If you can, use utf8 or utf8x (which is indeed the correct spelling for &latex; documents).
					</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Other options</guilabel>: this allows you to set further options such as printing,
				draft, and others.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>Packages</para>
			<para>This lists some of the most common additional packages used in &latex;. Select the check box to include it.</para>

			<para>Document Properties</para>
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Author</guilabel>: put your name here.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Title</guilabel>: add the document title here.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para><guilabel>Date</guilabel>: specify the date.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="intro_templates">

			<title>Predefined Templates</title>

			<para>The predefined templates in &kile; are:</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>Empty document: real freaks start from scratch!</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Article: sets the article format, for a document short enough not to
				be broken down to chapters.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Report: sets the report format, for a middle-sized document, with, for
				example, page numbering on the page's outer edge.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Book: sets the book format, a full-fledged flavor, so powerful that
				it is used to write many university textbooks.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Letter: sets the letter format.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Beamer, HA-Prosper: create nice presentations in PDF with a superior look and all
						&latex; power.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Powerdot: Powerdot is the follower of the packages <userinput>seminar</userinput>
				and <userinput>HA-Prosper</userinput>. It does not have as many options as Beamer,
				but it is easy to use and it can create really nice presentations in PDF.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Scrartcl, Scrbook, Scrreprt, Scrlttr2: the KOMA-Script document classes,
						especially adapted to German typography. Use them whenever you write German
						texts.</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>Xelatex: an modified <userinput>Article</userinput> template to use with
				<userinput>XeLaTeX</userinput>.</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>Note that all of these templates can be adjusted to the user's requirements.</para>

			<para>New users need not worry: this list is just a brief description of the available features,
			and a more detailed description can be found in <xref linkend="quickstart" role="select: title pageabbrv"/>.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="intro_highlight">

			<title>Syntax Highlighting</title>

			<para>&kile; is similar to other programs that deal with source code and editing, and will
			automatically highlight commands, options and items that are used (and abused).
			&kile; makes it possible to easily spot problematic areas: for example, if you see major
			areas of text turn green, it is likely that you forgot closing a math environment somewhere.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="intro_autocoml">

			<title>Auto-Completion of Environments</title>

			<para>The auto-completion of environments means that, when you begin a new environment by typing
			<userinput>\begin{environment}</userinput>, &kile; will automatically insert a matching
			<userinput>\end{environment}</userinput> command, with a line in between them
			for your text. You can of course deactivate it if you want in
			<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guisubmenu>Configure Kile...</guisubmenu>
			<guimenuitem>LaTeX</guimenuitem><guilabel>Environments</guilabel></menuchoice>.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="intro_jump">

			<title>Jump to Structure Element</title>

			<para>All documents are normally structured in a hierarchy of some type.
			&latex; allows you to break up documents into the following hierarchy
			(part being highest in the hierarchy, and subparagraph being lowest):</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem><para>\part</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>\chapter</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>\section</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>\subsection</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>\subsubsection</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>\paragraph</para></listitem>
				<listitem><para>\subparagraph</para></listitem>
			</itemizedlist>

			<para>When viewing a document in the <guilabel>Structure</guilabel> view, you can jump
			between elements by clicking on the element you would like to view.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="intro_inverse">

			<title>Inverse Search</title>

			<para>When creating your own &latex; files, inverse search can be very helpful. Once you
			have created a &DVI; file (DeVice Independent File) or PDF file, you can click the left
			mouse button while pressing &Shift; in the viewer and &kile; will jump to the corresponding line in the
			&latex; source code.</para>

			<para>A &DVI; is a type of file containing a
			description of a formatted document, along with other
			information including character font, and is besides PDF the usual output of
			&tex; or &latex;. A number of utilities exist to view, convert and print &DVI; files on
			various systems and devices.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="intro_forward">

			<title>Forward Search</title>

			<para>When using inverse search, the selection of items in the &DVI; or PDF file is associated with
			the editor, so when you click on the &DVI; or PDF file, the main window jumps to the
			corresponding section of &latex; code in the editor. Forward search is the exact
			opposite of this. Forward search will allow you to click on a specific section of text
			in the &latex; code, and jump to the associated position in the viewer window.</para>

		<para>If you look at the <guilabel>Edit</guilabel> toolbar, you will notice three large
		drop-down menus. The drop-down menus were designed for you to be able to quickly add
		certain common features into your document. The first drop down box
		is used for quickly dividing your document by parts, chapter, sections and so on; the
		available commands to add segments to your &latex; source code are:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para><guilabel>part</guilabel>: highest level of sectioning for a document.</para></listitem>

		<title>Writing a &latex; Document with &kile; for Beginners</title>

		<para>Users of &kile; have two choices when starting a new document: they can use the
		<guimenu>Wizard</guimenu> to begin a new document, select the type of document they
		would like to create and options such as font size, paper size, and so on; otherwise,
		they can write the code by hand.</para>

<programlisting>\documentclass[12pt]{article}
\begin{document}
	Here is a bunch of text coded in \LaTeX.
\end{document}</programlisting>

		<para>Every document in &latex; begins with the command <userinput>
		\documentclass[optional argument]{class}</userinput>, where class specifies the document type.</para>

		<para>Typing in the code example above from the text box gives you the following output:</para>

		<screenshot>
			<screeninfo>Compiled text in &DVI; output</screeninfo>
			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="latex_example.png" format="PNG" />

					<phrase>Compiled text in &DVI; output</phrase>
				</textobject>
				<caption><para>Compiled text in &DVI; output</para></caption>
			</mediaobject>
		</screenshot>

		<para>The brackets that come after the command <userinput>\documentclass</userinput>
		contain the options for the command. The option <userinput>[12pt]</userinput> sets the size
		of the font for your article; if you do not set the font size in the beginning, you can set
		it later in the text.</para>

		<para>Once you have typed in the code example from the box above, you will need to
		compile your &latex; source code. The easiest way for you to compile &latex; is to

		<step><para>Decide whether your image shall be centered on the page.</para></step>

		<step><para>Choose whether you want the <userinput>\graphicspath</userinput>

		<para>By default graphics files have to be in the same

		it is possible to put them in other folders to make
		things tidier. Without a <userinput>\graphicspath</userinput>
		command, &kile; would include the path for the graphics file.
		But if you use <userinput>\graphicspath</userinput> in your
		preamble like this:</para>

		<programlisting>\graphicspath{{/path/to/my/graphics}{other/path/to/more/graphics}}</programlisting>

		<para>and check this option, &kile; will only use the

		<para>Another example: if you set <userinput>\graphicspath</userinput>

		<programlisting>\graphicspath{{./}{camera/}{images/}}</programlisting>

		<para>&latex; will search in the current folder, then in
		<filename>camera</filename> and finally in
		<filename>images</filename> to find your graphics file.</para></step>

		<step><para>If you choose either a width or a height, the whole graphics
		will be proportionally scaled. If you set two values for width and height
		at the same time, width and height may be scaled with different factors,
		and this could not be what you want. See also the information near the top
		of dialog to know the original size of the graphics.</para></step>

		when you choose a graphics file. This information is only needed
		when you work with traditional &latex; and bitmapped graphics.
		See the discussion of <link linkend="build_epsgraphics">EPS graphics</link>.
		</para>

		<para>If &latex; needs a bounding box and you do not want to generate a bb file,
		&kile; supports this option. On the other side, &pdflatex; will give a warning,

		enables or disables the bounding box option.</para></step>

		<step><para>Scale the image by the desired scale factor. &eg;, 0.5 to reduce by half,

		<title>Arrays and tabulars</title>

		<para>One of the most boring jobs one can do in &latex; is to write a matrix or a
		tabular environment. One has to keep track of all the elements, ensure that the environment
		is well formed, and that all things are where they are supposed to be. Good indentation helps,
		but there is a simpler way: using &kile;'s <menuchoice><guimenu>Wizard</guimenu><guimenuitem>Array</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
		or
		<menuchoice><guimenu>Wizard</guimenu><guimenuitem>Tabular</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu entries.
		You will then have a matrix-formed input form that you can easily fill in with your entries. This dialog also
		offers some options to typeset the tabular material.</para>

		<title>Using Bibitems</title>

		<para><userinput>\bibitem</userinput> is a command used to enter a reference in a
		<userinput>thebibliography</userinput> environment in your document. The syntax for using
		<userinput>\bibitem</userinput> is <userinput>\bibitem[label]{key}</userinput>.</para>

		<para>The optional <userinput>[label]</userinput> is for you to add your own
		labeling system for the bibliography entry. If no label is set, the entries
		will be set in numerical order: [1], [2], [3], &etc;</para>

		<para>The argument <userinput>{key}</userinput> is used to reference and link the commands
		<userinput>\bibitem</userinput> and <userinput>\cite</userinput> to
		each other and the information they contain. The command <userinput>\cite</userinput> contains the
		label associated with the intended <userinput>\bibitem</userinput>, which is located inside a
		<userinput>thebibliography</userinput> environment, and contains the reference data.
		Both corresponding <userinput>\bibitem</userinput> and <userinput>\cite</userinput> must
		have the same <userinput>{key}</userinput>; the easiest way to organize keys is by
		the author's last name. The secondary braces in the <userinput>thebibliography</userinput>
		environment denote the longest bibliography label you expect to have.
		So, inserting <userinput>{<replaceable>foo</replaceable>}</userinput> means
		you can have any label shorter or as large as the expression
		<userinput><replaceable>foo</replaceable></userinput>. Failure to set this parameter correctly
		may result in a not so attractive indentation of your bibliography.</para>

		<para>The bibliography is a section apart from your main document, and an example of
		code for the bibliography would look like the following:</para>

<programlisting>\begin{thebibliography}{50}
	\bibitem{Simpson} Homer J. Simpson. \textsl{Mmmmm...donuts}. Evergreen Terrace Printing Co.,
	                  Springfield, SomewhereUSA, 1998
\end{thebibliography}</programlisting>

		<para>Then, your main source code would contain the location of the information relating to
		the <userinput>\bibitem</userinput> using <userinput>\cite</userinput>. That source code would look similar to this:</para>

		<programlisting>My thesis, about the philosophy of The Simpsons\copyright comes from my favorite book \cite{Simpson}.</programlisting>

		<para>As it is often difficult to remember the exact citation key once you have many
		references, &kile; provides an easy way to insert a citation. Using <menuchoice><guimenu>LaTeX
		</guimenu><guimenuitem>References</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Cite</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
		a list with all the citation keys pops up. Select the correct
		reference and a citation will be inserted into your document. To update the list of keys,
		either save the file, or <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Refresh
		Structure</guimenuitem></menuchoice>, or press <keycap>F12</keycap>.
		With code completion enabled, &kile; will show you a list of all the <userinput>bibitem</userinput>-labels
		as soon as you open up a <userinput>\cite</userinput> command.</para>

		<para>The final result in your document's bibliography would then look like this:</para>

		<para><computeroutput>[1] Homer J. Simpson. Mmmmm...donuts. Evergreen Terrace Printing Co.,
		Springfield, SomewhereUSA, 1998.</computeroutput></para>

		<para>&kile; can also work together with &bibtex; editors,
		such as &kbibtex; to make it easier to enter citations. When a &bibtex; file is added to the project,
		&kile; will help you complete citation commands, just as described above</para>

		<title>Graphics Conversion</title>

		<para>To overcome this frustrating loop, in case you want to include both &PostScript; code and PNG or JPG files,

		<itemizedlist>
			<listitem><para>If you need a file in PS format, but have JPG or PNG graphics, you can also
			simply use &pdflatex; with &DVI; output first, and then run <application>dvips</application>

			no &PostScript; code at all.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>You can convert EPS files to PNG or other formats with utilities as the
			<ulink url="http://www.gimp.org/"><application>Gimp</application></ulink> or
			<ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">&imagemagick;</ulink>
			and use &pdflatex;.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para><anchor id="build_graphics_epstopdf"></anchor>A preferred way
			is to convert EPS graphics to PDF graphics with
			<command>epstopdf</command>, which comes with every &tex; distribution
			and then use &pdflatex;. It produces high quality graphics,
			and you can even control the result with some of the following options:

<programlisting>
	-dAutoFilterColorImages=false
	-dAutoFilterGrayImages=false
	-sColorImageFilter=FlateEncode
	-sGrayImageFilter=FlateEncode
	-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress
	-dUseFlateCompression=true
</programlisting>
			</para>

			<para>Even better: if your system allows <userinput>shell-escape</userinput>, conversion
			can be done on the fly. All you have to do is to include the <application>epstopdf</application> package,
			which is part of all &tex; distributions, with command <userinput>\usepackage{epstopdf}</userinput>.
			Assuming that your code is

<programlisting>
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{test.eps}
</programlisting>

			When you call &pdflatex; with option <option>--shell-escape</option>,
			graphics <filename>test.eps</filename> is automatically converted into <filename>test.pdf</filename>.</para>

			<para>This conversion will take place each time you run &pdflatex;.
			If your graphics command is given implicitly:

<programlisting>
	\includegraphics[width=5cm]{test}
</programlisting>

			<application>epstopdf</application> checks whether <filename>test.pdf</filename> is already
			available, so that conversion step can be skipped.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>You can convert the other way around, and use &latex; and PS-PDF conversion.
			This is not always a good idea, since EPS encapsulation of JPG or PNG can yield larger
			files, that in turn yield unnecessarily large documents. This is however <emphasis>highly</emphasis>
			dependent on the graphic utility that you use, since EPS can encapsulate other graphics,
			but not all applications support this perfectly. Some might actually try to build your JPG image
			with vectors and various scripting, which will result in gigantic files. Conversion of
			all graphics formats to EPS can be done by

		<title>EPS Graphics</title>

		<para>EPS graphics files are the traditional way to insert graphics files into
		&latex; documents. As mailing lists are full with questions concerning
		EPS graphics, we will discuss some important aspects and
		demonstrate how &kile; supports them.</para>

		<sect2 id="build_graphics_eps">

		<title>&latex; and EPS Graphics</title>

		<para>If you decided to use the traditional &latex; to produce
		PS or PDF output, you will probably run into some problems
		with graphics. You have to use EPS graphics (Encapsulated &PostScript;),
		no JPEG or PNG files. This should be no problem, as there are a lot of
		<link linkend="build_graphics_conversion">converters</link> like
		<command>convert</command> from the excellent
		<ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">&imagemagick;</ulink>
		package. But, it needs some time of course.</para>

		<para>The EPS files are used by both &latex; and the &DVI;-PS converter:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>&latex; scans the EPS file for the bounding box
		line, which tells &latex; how much space to reserve for the
		graphics.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>The &DVI;-PS converter then reads the EPS file and
		inserts the graphics in the PS file.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>This has some implications:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>&latex; never reads the EPS file if the bounding-box
		parameters are specified in the graphics-insertion command.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>Since &latex; cannot read non-ASCII files,
		it cannot read the bounding-box information from compressed or non-EPS
		graphics files.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>The EPS graphics are not included in the &DVI; file. Since the
		EPS files must be present when the &DVI; file is converted to
		PS, the EPS files must accompany &DVI; files whenever they are
		moved.</para></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>

		<para>Now you can call &latex;, and a &DVI;-PS converter like <application>dvips</application>
		to create your &PostScript; document. If your goal is a PDF document, you should run
		<command>dvips</command> with option <option>-Ppdf</option> and then call
		<command>ps2pdf</command>. You will find a lot of documents describing this solution.</para>

		</sect2>

		<sect2 id="build_graphics_epskile">

		<title>The &PostScript; Way of &kile;</title>

		<para>&kile; helps you to get the bounding-box information. If you have installed
		<ulink url="http://www.imagemagick.org/">&imagemagick;</ulink>
		package, &kile; will extract this information from the EPS file and insert it as an
		option. This is done automatically when you select the graphics file.
		There are two advantages to proceed like this:</para>

		<itemizedlist>
		<listitem><para>The information is already scanned in the dialog, and
		need not to be done by &latex; later on.</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>Even more important is that the width and height of the picture

		<listitem><para>&kile; can also support zipped or gzipped EPS files,

		<para>&latex; needs some information about the file suffixes. The package
		<userinput>graphicx</userinput> looks for a file <filename>graphics.cfg</filename>,

</programlisting>

		<para>You will find this file, for example in Debian, at
		<filename>/etc/texmf/latex/graphics.cfg</filename>. The best way to proceed is to copy this
		file to your local texpath and then change this file. See the yours &tex; distribution manual
		to learn how to get a list of your &tex; folders.</para>

		<para>With this configuration file you are able to insert bitmap graphics and
		zipped or gzipped EPS files in &latex;. The command for conversion
		is given by <command>dvips</command>. When you look
		at the conversion command you will see that no extra file is created.
		The result of the conversion process is directly piped into the PS file.
		The only thing &latex; must know is the size of the graphics, and
		therefore we need the bounding box, which is provided by &kile;.</para>

		<para>Some say that this way is insecure; you have to decide on how to work.
		In any case, you need no bounding box, as &kile; will extract this information

<programlisting>
   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

		<para>Now you can already include EPS graphics, if you run <command>pdflatex</command>

		This time we search for:</para>

<programlisting>
   % pdfTeX is running in pdf mode
   \ExecuteOptions{pdftex}%

	specifies the encoding you would like to use (nowadays in most cases <userinput>utf8</userinput>). This tells &latex;
	to translate all of the <userinput>ë</userinput>'s you wrote to <userinput>\"e</userinput>'s before
	compiling. Please refer to the <application>inputenc</application> documentation directly for more
	information. Last but not least: remember to make sure that your file is <emphasis>actually</emphasis> saved
	in the same encoding you specified for the <application>inputenc</application> package!</para>

	<para>This multitude of different character coding tables has created numerous problems: for example,
	you cannot write a course of Turkish in French without losing one language's special characters.
	There is general agreement that, sooner or later,
	everybody will switch to <ulink url="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</ulink>. There
	are many implementations of Unicode, and <abbrev>UTF-8</abbrev> is the most
	successful in &Linux;; &Windows;&reg; relies instead on the more cumbersome and
	less flexible <abbrev>UCS-2</abbrev>. Most distributions have already
	begun setting their default encoding to <abbrev>UTF-8</abbrev>, and therefore you
	may be very interested in using of the <userinput>utf8</userinput> argument to the
	<userinput>inputenc</userinput> package.</para>

		<para>Adding support for ideographic languages is quite tricky. However, once

		<tip><para>Your &Linux; distribution might already have a &cjk; (Chinese, Japanese,
		Korean) package ready for you, so you might be saved the hassle of manually
		installing everything. Do check before going forward!</para></tip>

		<para>There is the possibility of using the &ucs; package in order to write
		short snippets of &cjk; text, but that option is seriously limited as it does
		not handle, among other things, newlines. Instead, we will install the complete
		&cjk;-&latex; package and make it work for both &latex; and &pdflatex;. A lot
		of this material has been inspired by <ulink url="http://www.ece.uci.edu/~chou/">Pai

		before (see <xref linkend="ucs" role="select: title pageabbrv"/>). The files will be unpacked in a
		<filename>CJK/X_Y.Z</filename> folder; it is not important that you
		take them out, though it will probably be tidier and easier for you to
		maintain.</para></listitem>

		<listitem><para>Now you have to download a font that supports all the &cjk; characters
		you need. You can choose any <literal role="extension">*.ttf</literal> file that

			<title>&cjk; Troubleshooting</title>

			<para>There are many things that can go wrong when setting &cjk;
			support manually. If something seems not to work, the following
			checklist might help you.</para>

			<itemizedlist>

			<listitem><para>Obviously, since you run &latex; as a user and
			not as root, you must <emphasis>allow</emphasis> ordinary users
			to access the new files. Make sure all folders and files are
			accessible using the <command>chmod</command> command.</para></listitem>

			<listitem><para>If &latex; writes a &DVI; without problems, but you
			cannot view it, it is almost certainly because of some problems in the
			automatic generation of <literal role="extension">*.pk</literal>
			fonts. They are supposed to be generated on the fly when viewing a
			&DVI; file, but this might fail for a number of reasons: double-check
			<filename>ttfonts.map</filename> for your custom line first. However,
			it might happen that your <command>ttf2pk</command> command, which
			is usually invoked by the &DVI; viewer, has been compiled
			<emphasis>without</emphasis> support for the
			<application>kpathsea</application> libraries. If this is the case,
			<userinput><command>ttf2pk</command> <option>--version</option></userinput>
			will make no mention of <application>kpathsea</application>. As support for
			these libraries is necessary, you might have to find a new package, or
			recompile <application>FreeType 1</application> by yourself.</para></listitem>

		<sect2>

			<title>How do I input &cjk; in Unicode?</title>

			<para>There are a number of different input engines, and the choice can
			depend also on personal preference. The author uses <ulink
			url="http://www.scim-im.org/projects/skim"><application>Skim</application></ulink>,
			a port to &kde; of the <ulink
			url="http://www.scim-im.org"><application>Scim</application></ulink>
			engine. Refer to your distribution's documentation to learn how to
			install these programs. Configuration of such programs can be tricky
