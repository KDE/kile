This document describes Kile's DCOP interface, the parts of the Lyx protocol known by Kile and
the services Kile can use from other KDE apps.

1. Kile's DCOP interface

Open a file either by absolute or relative path:
	virtual void openDocument(const QString &);

Insert text at the cursor position in the current document; this can be used to replace Lyx's pipe mechanism:
	virtual void insertText(const QString &);

Same effect as openDocument; kept for backward compatibility:
	virtual void fileSelected(const QString &);

Close the current document:
	virtual void closeDocument();

Open a Kile project file, either by absolute or relative path:
	virtual void openProject(const QString &);

Jump to the given line in the current document; please note that the parameter is not of the type 'int' but of 'QString' instead:
	virtual void setLine(const QString &);

Raise Kile's main window; does not steal the focus:
	virtual void setActive();

Run the given tool; the return values are { Running = 0, ConfigureFailed, NoLauncherInstalled, NoValidTarget, NoValidSource, TargetHasWrongPermissions, NoValidPrereqs, CouldNotLaunch, SelfCheckFailed}:
	virtual int run(const QString &);

Run the given tool with a specific configuration as second parameter; returns the same values as the function above:
	virtual int runWith(const QString &, const QString &);


2. Kile's Lyx Pipe emulation

The following Lyx commands are understood by Kile.

Insert the citations $Name1, Name2, ... at the current cursor postion; the citation command is hard coded to '\cite':
	:citation-insert:$Name1,$Name2

Insert the command \bibliography with the files named $myBib1, $myBib2, ... at the current cursor position:
	:bibtex-database-add:$myBib

Insert the string $text at the current cursor position:
	:paste:$text


3. Services usable Kile

Kile can ask a BibTeX manager to insert all marked citations; for example, via the menu item "LaTeX->References->cite from viewBib".
Currently only KBib (http://user.digisurf.com.au/~thachly/kbib) is supported. If you want to get your application added, please contact us
at kile-devel _ aht_ lists.sourceforge.net.
