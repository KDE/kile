SVN commit 796505 by tbraun:

revert old codecompletion fix from 771425 because it created more problems as it solved

add new very hackish codecompletion fix. I tried for half an hour an didn't find any regressions.
And I also hope that our users do also not :)

These two bugs are in principle fixed with this commit, but I wait until it it confirmed
CCBUG: 155044
