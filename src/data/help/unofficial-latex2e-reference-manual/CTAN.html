<!-- This document is an unofficial reference manual for LaTeX, a
document preparation system, version of November 2018.

This manual was originally translated from LATEX.HLP v1.0a in the
VMS Help Library.  The pre-translation version was written by
George D. Greenwade of Sam Houston State University.  The
LaTeX 2.09 version was written by Stephen Gilmore.  The
LaTeX2e version was adapted from this by Torsten Martinsen.  Karl
Berry made further updates and additions, and gratefully acknowledges
using Hypertext Help with LaTeX, by Sheldon Green, and
LaTeX Command Summary (for LaTeX 2.09) by
L. Botway and C. Biemesderfer (published by the TeX Users
Group as TeXniques number 10), as reference material.  We also
gratefully acknowledge additional material appearing in
latex2e-reference by Martin Herbert Dietze.  (From these references no
text was directly copied.)

<a name="index-CTAN"></a>

<p>The Comprehensive TeX Archive Network, CTAN, is the TeX and
LaTeX community&rsquo;s repository of free material.  It is a set of
Internet sites around the world that offer material related to LaTeX
for download.  Visit CTAN on the web at <a href="https://ctan.org">https://ctan.org</a>.
</p>
<p>This material is organized into packages, discrete bundles that
typically offer some coherent functionality and are maintained by one
person or a small number of people.  For instance, many publishers have
a package that allows authors to format papers to that publisher&rsquo;s
specifications.
</p>
<p>In addition to the massive holdings, the web site offers features such
as search by name or by functionality.
</p>
<a name="index-DANTE-e_002eV_002e"></a>
<a name="index-mirrors-of-CTAN"></a>
<p>CTAN is not a single site, but instead is a set of sites. One of the
sites is the core. This site actively manages the material, for
instance, by accepting uploads of new or updated packages. It is
hosted by the German TeX group DANTE e.V. Other sites around the
world help out by mirroring, that is, automatically syncing their
collections with the core site and then in turn making their copies
publicly available. This gives users close to their location better
access and relieves the load on the core site. The list of mirrors is
at <a href="https://ctan.org/mirrors">https://ctan.org/mirrors</a>.
