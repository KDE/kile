<h3 class="section">27.5 <code>\write</code></h3>

<a name="index-_005cwrite"></a>

<p>Synopsis:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\write<var>number</var>{<var>string</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Write <code>string</code> to the log file, to the terminal, or to a file
opened by <code>\openout</code>.  For instance, <code>\write6</code> writes to text
stream number&nbsp;6.
</p>
<p>If the following appears in <samp><var>basefile</var>.tex</samp> then it opens
<samp><var>basefile</var>.jh</samp>, writes &lsquo;<samp>Hello World!</samp>&rsquo; and a newline to
it, and closes that file.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\newwrite\myfile
\immediate\openout\myfile=\jobname.jh   % \jobname is current file name
  ...
\immediate\write\myfile{Hello world!}
  ...
\immediate\closeout\myfile
</pre></div>

<p>The <code>\newwrite</code> allocates a stream number, giving it a symbolic
names to make life easier, so that <code>test
\newwrite\myfile\the\myfile</code> produces something like &lsquo;<samp>test 3</samp>&rsquo;.
Then <code>\openout</code> associates the stream number with the given file
name.  With that, <code>\write3</code> puts the string in the file.
</p>
<p>Typically <var>number</var> is between 0 and&nbsp;15 because typically
LaTeX authors follow the prior example and the number is allocated by
the system.  If <var>number</var> is outside the range from 0 to 15 or if it
is not associated with an open file then LaTeX writes <var>string</var> to
the log file.  If <var>number</var> is positive then in addition LaTeX
writes <var>string</var> to the terminal. Thus, <code>test \write-1{Hello
World!}</code> puts &lsquo;<samp>Hello World!</samp>&rsquo; followed by a newline in the log
file.  (This is what the <code>\wlog</code> command does; see <a href="_005cwlog.html#g_t_005cwlog">\wlog</a>).  And
<code>\write100{Hello World!}</code> puts the same in the log file but also
puts &lsquo;<samp>Hello World!</samp>&rsquo; followed by a newline in the terminal output.
(But 16, 17, and 18 are special as <var>number</var>; see below.)
</p>
<p>In LuaTeX, instead of 16 output streams there are 256
(see <a href="TeX-engines.html#TeX-engines">TeX engines</a>).
</p>
<p>Write to the current <samp>.aux</samp> file, which is associated with the main
file or with the current include file, using
<code>\write\@auxout{<var>string</var>}</code>.  Write to the main <samp>.aux</samp>
file using <code>\write\@mainaux{<var>string</var>}</code>.
</p>
<p>By default LaTeX does not write <var>string</var> to the file right away.
This is because, for example, you may use <code>\write</code> to save the
current page number but when TeX comes across a <code>\write</code> it may
be not yet sure what page this is, since it has not yet done the page
breaking.  So you <code>\write</code> in one of three contexts.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\immediate\write\@auxout{<var>string</var>}
\write\@auxout{<var>string</var>}
\protected@write\@auxout{}{<var>string</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>With the first, LaTeX writes <var>string</var> to the file.  Any commands
in <var>string</var> will be expanded (just as in <code>\edef</code> so that to
prevent expansion you should use <code>\noexpand</code> or a <code>toks</code>,
except that you should use <code>#</code> instead of <code>##</code>).  With the
second, <var>string</var> is stored on the current list of things (as a
TeX &ldquo;whatsit&rdquo;) and kept until the page is shipped out and likewise
the commands are unexpanded until shipout.  The third,
<code>\protected@write</code>, is like the second except that you can use
<code>\protect</code> on fragile commands. The extra first argument allows you
to locally insert extra definitions to make more commands be safe or
have special definition during the write.
</p>
<p>Here <var>string</var> contains a control sequence.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\newwrite\jhfile
\openout\jhfile=test.jh
\newcommand{\triplex}{XXX}
\write\jhfile{test \triplex test}
</pre></div>

<p>This results in the file <samp>test.jh</samp> containing &lsquo;<samp>test XXXtest</samp>&rsquo;
followed by a newline.
</p>
<p>The cases where <var>number</var> is 16, 17, or 18 are special.  Because of
<code>\write</code>&rsquo;s behavior when <var>number</var> is outside the range from 0
to 15 described above, in Plain&nbsp;TeX <code>\write16</code> and
<code>\write17</code> were sometimes used to write to the log file and the
terminal.  Note that in LaTeX the natural way to do that is with
<code>\typeout</code> (see <a href="_005ctypeout.html#g_t_005ctypeout">\typeout</a>).  The <code>\write18</code> command is even
more special; modern TeX systems use it for giving commands to the
operating system (see <a href="_005cwrite18.html#g_t_005cwrite18">\write18</a>).
</p>
<p>Ordinarily <code>\write</code> outputs a single line.  Put in a newline with
<code>^^J</code>.  Thus, this produces two lines in the log file.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\wlog{Parallel lines have a lot in common.^^JBut they never meet.}
</pre></div>

<p>The ability to write files raises security issues. If you compiled a
downloaded LaTeX file and it overwrote your password file then you
would be justifiably troubled. TeX systems by default only allow
you to open files for writing that are in the current directory or in
a subdirectory. This
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\newwrite\jhfile
\openout\jhfile=../test.jh
</pre></div>

<p>gives an error like &lsquo;<samp>Not writing to ../test.jh (openout_any = p). !
I can't write on file `../test.jh'</samp>&rsquo;.  Note that you can get such an
error when trying to use commands such as <code>\include{../filename}</code>
because LaTeX will try to open <samp>../filename.aux</samp>.  The simplest
solution is to put the included files in the same directory as the
master file, or in subdirectories.
</p>
<a name="index-package_002c-answers"></a>
<a name="index-answers-package"></a>

<p>A common case where authors want to write a file not already provided by
LaTeX is for answers to exercises, or some other situation where you
want to write out verbatim, without expanding the commands.  CTAN has a
number of packages for this; one is <samp>answers</samp>.
