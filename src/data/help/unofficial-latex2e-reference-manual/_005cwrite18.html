<a name="index-commands_002c-run-from-LaTeX"></a>

<p>Synopsis:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\write18{<var>shell_command</var>}
</pre></div>

<p>Issue a command to the operating system shell.  The operating system
runs the command and LaTeX&rsquo;s execution is blocked until that
finishes.
</p>
<a name="index-package_002c-Asymptote-3"></a>
<a name="index-Asymptote-package-3"></a>

<p>This
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\usepackage{graphicx}  % in preamble
  ...
\newcommand{\fignum}{1}
\immediate\write18{cd pix &amp;&amp; asy figure\fignum}
\includegraphics{pix\figure\fignum.pdf}
</pre></div>

<p>will run <samp>Asymptote</samp> on <samp>pix/figure1.asy</samp>, so that the
document can later read in the resulting graphic
(see <a href="_005cincludegraphics.html#g_t_005cincludegraphics">\includegraphics</a>).  Like any <code>\write</code>, here LaTeX
expands macros in <var>shell_command</var> so that <code>\fignum</code> is replaced
by &lsquo;<samp>1</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Another example is that you can automatically run BibTeX at the start
of each LaTeX run (see <a href="Using-BibTeX.html#Using-BibTeX">Using BibTeX</a>) by including
<code>\immediate\write18{bibtex8 \jobname}</code> as the first line of the
file.  Note that <code>\jobname</code> gives the base name of the current
file.
</p>
<p>You sometimes need to do a multi-step process to get the information
that you want.  This will insert into the input a list of all PDF files
in the current directory.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">\immediate\write18{ls *.pdf &gt; tmp.dat}
\input{tmp.dat}
</pre></div>

<p>The standard behaviour of any <code>\write</code> is to wait until a page is
being shipped out before expanding the macros or writing to the stream
(see <a href="_005cwrite.html#g_t_005cwrite">\write</a>). But sometimes you want it done now.  For this, use
<code>\immediate\write18{<var>shell_command</var>}</code>.
</p>
<p>There are obvious security issues with allowing system commands inside a
LaTeX file.  If you download a file off the net and it contains
commands to delete all your files then you would be annoyed. The
standard settings in modern distributions turn off full shell
access. You can turn it on, if you are sure the shell commands are safe,
by compiling with <code>latex --shell-escape <var>filename</var></code> for TeX
Live or MacTeX or <code>latex --enable-write18 <var>filename</var></code> for
MiKTeX (see <a href="Command-line-options.html#Command-line-options">Command line options</a>).
</p>
<p>In the place of full shell access, modern distributions by default use a
restricted version that allows some commands to work, such as those that
run Metafont to generate missing fonts, even if you do not use the
<code>shell-escape</code> or <code>enable-write18</code> option. By default this
list of allowed commands is short and features only commands that are
under the control of the distribution maintainers (see <a href="Command-line-options.html#Command-line-options">Command line options</a>).
</p>
<p>Some packages need to run external system commands. For instance
<samp>sagetex</samp> allows you to have the mathematics software system
<i>Sage</i> do calculations or draw graphs and then incorporate that output
in your document. For this you must compile with full <code>\write18</code>
capability turned on.
