As of today (06/01/2009) the syntax files are no longer part of kile they are now only in the main KDE repository.
To upgrade to the latest syntax files go from inside kile with at least one document open
 to configure kile->editor->Open/Save and select download syntax highlighting files. Then choose the highlighting files
you wish to upgrade.
